# Football Pool App

## What is it

This began as a side project for me to play around with react as well as assist me in deciding who to pick in my family football pool. Eventually It will have the ability to be linked to a backend of sorts so that it can host the football pool itself.

## What can it do now
Currently it just collects teams, schedules, and statistics from the ESPN API and presents it in a few different views. 

## Roadmap

- Authentication and user management
- Backend for storing picks
- Graphs and tables to track correct picks
- Gen AI to provide a guess of who should win based off of records/available statistics
